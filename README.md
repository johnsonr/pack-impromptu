# realm-impromptu

Classical / art-music companion for the Embabel assistant — grounded in the
works the user has rated, live Open Opus metadata, recordings on YouTube, and
public-domain scores on IMSLP.

This realm is the art-music analogue of [`realm-movie`](../realm-movie): where the
movie realm recommends films grounded in ratings + OMDb + streaming, this realm
recommends musical works grounded in ratings + Open Opus + YouTube + IMSLP. It
is a distillation of the standalone [`impromptu`](../impromptu) app (a Spring
Boot classical-music assistant with hand-coded actions, Neo4j persistence, and
its own UI) down to the things a realm can ship: APIs, types, a workflow skill,
and a personality. The chat LLM owns the workflow; the assistant owns the
persistence and the UI.

> **Requires [`realm-research`](../realm-research)** for the `brave`
> web search that finds recordings (`gateway.brave.webSearch`). It's a vendored
> OpenAPI spec there — general enough to be shared, and deliberately not an MCP
> server. Without realm-research, everything else (work lookup, scores, ratings,
> recommendations) still works; only recording lookups go quiet.

## What's in the realm

| Directory | What it contributes |
|---|---|
| `apis/` | One OpenAPI 3 spec — **Open Opus** (`gateway.openopus.omnisearch`, free/no-auth work metadata). Recordings are YouTube watch links found via **Brave web search** (`gateway.brave.webSearch` with `site:youtube.com/watch` — the YouTube Data API's `search.list` costs 100 quota units per call, ~100 searches/day free), vendored in **[realm-research](../realm-research)** (a shared, reusable capability — NOT MCP), so this realm **requires realm-research** installed. Calls go through the gateway from `execute_javascript`. |
| `types/music.yml` | `MusicalWork` (canonical metadata, keyed by Open Opus id) + `MusicalWorkRating` (the user's score), plus two **virtual** types materialized on demand: `MusicalRecording` (YouTube) and the fan-in `MusicalTasteSummary`. (Printed scores are deliberately NOT a virtual type — the `music` skill searches IMSLP directly in code mode; the crawl is too slow for query-time joins.) Every type is `Musical*`-namespaced so it can't collide with another realm's `Work`/`Recording`/`Score`. |
| `producers/impromptu.yml` | The four virtual-join producers: `similarWorks` (generative `SIMILAR_TO`), `recordingsByWork` (remote `HAS_RECORDING` — YouTube links via Brave search), `workTasteSummary` (aggregate `HAS_MUSICAL_TASTE_SUMMARY`), `tasteBasedWorks` (generative `SUGGESTS`). |
| `skills/music/` | One skill for everything: look up a work, find a recording or score, recommend, rate, recall. Owns the Open Opus + recording-search workflow and the cardinal rules (always search with `<composer> <title>`; never fabricate an id/recording/score). |
| `personalities/maestro/` | Concert-programme-note voice — used only by the recommendation / write-up path. Rate confirmations and recall replies stay in the default assistant voice. |
| `views/` , `lenses/` | Saved Cypher views — tabular "listen + score" recommendations (`WorkRecommendations`, `TasteBasedRecommendations`: composer, work, a YouTube recording, an IMSLP score), cheap browse views (`ChamberRecommendations`, `WorksYoullProbablyDislike`), and `MyMusicTaste` (falls back to "No works rated") — plus JS lenses (`Rated Works`, `Recommendations You Can Hear`, `Your Music Taste`, `Top 3 — Scores`). |
| `focuses/music.yml` | `/focus music` — scopes chat to this realm + the `maestro` persona. |
| `apps/MusicalWork.component.js` | The `MusicalWork` entity card: play button (top YouTube recording), composer, genre badges, and a 1–10 rating widget. |
| `src/api/work.ts` | The **`MusicalWork` type** — a TypeScript class `extends Entity`. Fields are the shape; async methods (`work.recordings`, `work.details`, `work.rate`, inherited `work.neighbors`) are affordances callable on an in-scope object. Built to `dist/`. |

## Setup

- **Open Opus** needs no key.
- **Recording search** (Brave) is provided by **realm-research** — install it and set a
  [Brave Search API](https://brave.com/search/api/) key on the assistant process:
  ```bash
  export BRAVE_API_KEY=...
  ```
  This is a deployment-level key, not per-user OAuth. (No Google/YouTube key: the YouTube
  Data API's `search.list` costs 100 quota units per call — ~100 searches/day free — while
  a Brave hit's `url` is already the watch link.)
- **IMSLP** needs no key — the `music` skill finds score pages with a direct Brave web
  search (`site:imslp.org`); IMSLP's own lookup is a multi-step MediaWiki crawl, so it is
  deliberately not an API integration nor a graph join.

## How a work reaches its recordings and scores

A `MusicalWork` carries a `searchQuery` scalar (`"<composer> <title>"`). That single
string is the join key for both media edges, so the graph can go:

```
(MusicalWorkRating)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(MusicalWork)-[:HAS_RECORDING]->(MusicalRecording)   # YouTube
```

The recommendation producers (`similarWorks`, `tasteBasedWorks`) resolve each
LLM-suggested work name onto the Open Opus spine (so it dedupes against works the
user already rated) and stamp the suggested `<composer> <title>` as the new work's
`searchQuery` — so a recommended work can chain straight into its recording or score.

## Sample queries

Run these in the Cypher console (Settings → Data → **Query**). Each virtual edge
materializes on demand. Keep a virtual join in the **leading `MATCH` chain** (a join
after a `WITH` is not materialized), and put `LIMIT`/`ORDER BY` at the end.

**Instant (Neo4j only)**
```cypher
-- Your top-rated works
MATCH (me:AssistantUser)-[:RATED]->(r:MusicalWorkRating)
RETURN r.composer, r.title, r.rating ORDER BY r.rating DESC, r.title LIMIT 15
```

**Generative (SIMILAR_TO / fan-IN summary / two-stage SUGGESTS)**
```cypher
-- Recommendations from works you LOVED, excluding what you've rated
MATCH (me:AssistantUser)-[:RATED]->(rt:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE rt.rating >= 8
MATCH (rt)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(w:MusicalWork)
WHERE NOT EXISTS { (me)-[:RATED]->(seen:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE seen.workId = w.workId }
RETURN DISTINCT w.composer, w.title, w.genre LIMIT 15
```
```cypher
-- Your taste in ~100 words (a fan-IN aggregate node over all your ratings)
MATCH (me:AssistantUser)-[:HAS_MUSICAL_TASTE_SUMMARY]->(ts:MusicalTasteSummary)
RETURN ts.summary, ts.count
```
```cypher
-- Recommendations from your WHOLE taste (fan-IN summary → fan-OUT SUGGESTS)
MATCH (me:AssistantUser)-[:HAS_MUSICAL_TASTE_SUMMARY]->(ts:MusicalTasteSummary)
MATCH (ts)-[:SUGGESTS]->(w:MusicalWork)
WHERE NOT EXISTS { (me)-[:RATED]->(seen:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE seen.workId = w.workId }
RETURN DISTINCT w.composer, w.title, w.genre
```

**Recordings (HAS_RECORDING → YouTube)**
```cypher
-- Recommendations you can listen to right now
MATCH (me:AssistantUser)-[:RATED]->(rt:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE rt.rating >= 8
MATCH (rt)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(w:MusicalWork)-[:HAS_RECORDING]->(r:MusicalRecording)
WHERE NOT EXISTS { (me)-[:RATED]->(seen:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE seen.workId = w.workId }
RETURN w.composer, w.title, collect(r.title)[0..2] AS recordings
```

**LLM-judged (the `ai` namespace — steer a generative edge, rank, or filter on subjective taste)**

The `ai` namespace is reserved for per-row LLM judgment over what a virtual join has
fetched or generated — for a discriminator no stored property or embedding captures.
An `{ai: {…}}` directive map on a generative edge *steers and tunes* it (`hint`, plus
`model` — a world role like `chat_cheap` — `temperature`, `confidence`, `fresh`);
`ai.score(...)` *reranks*; `ai.relevant(...)` *filters*. The `hint` is a soft nudge, so
never pair it with a `WHERE` on the same edge.
```cypher
-- Recommendations from the works you loved, but nudge them wistful and autumnal —
-- generated by a cheap model, keeping only confident picks
MATCH (me:AssistantUser)-[:RATED]->(rt:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE rt.rating >= 8
MATCH (rt)-[:SIMILAR_TO {ai: {hint:'lean melancholic, autumnal, and introspective',
                              model:'chat_cheap', confidence: 0.7}}]->(w:MusicalWork)
WHERE NOT EXISTS { (me)-[:RATED]->(seen:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE seen.workId = w.workId }
RETURN DISTINCT w.composer, w.title, w.genre LIMIT 15
```
```cypher
-- Your five most adventurous, least-famous picks from your whole taste
MATCH (me:AssistantUser)-[:HAS_MUSICAL_TASTE_SUMMARY]->(ts:MusicalTasteSummary)
MATCH (ts)-[:SUGGESTS]->(w:MusicalWork)
WHERE NOT EXISTS { (me)-[:RATED]->(seen:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE seen.workId = w.workId }
RETURN w.composer, w.title, w.genre
ORDER BY ai.score(w, 'the most adventurous and least famous — a genuine discovery, not a warhorse') DESC LIMIT 5
```
```cypher
-- Recommendations you can hear, keeping only full-ensemble performances (no piano reductions or reaction videos)
MATCH (me:AssistantUser)-[:RATED]->(rt:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE rt.rating >= 8
MATCH (rt)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(w:MusicalWork)-[:HAS_RECORDING]->(r:MusicalRecording)
WHERE NOT EXISTS { (me)-[:RATED]->(seen:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE seen.workId = w.workId }
  AND ai.relevant(r, 'a full-ensemble performance of the work itself — not a solo-piano arrangement, cover, or reaction video')
RETURN w.composer, w.title, collect(r.title)[0..2] AS recordings
```

You can also click **Run** on the saved views in the console's **Views** tab, and
the lenses ship `Top 3 — Scores` (a direct IMSLP web search per top-rated work —
scores are deliberately not a graph join).

## Multi-person taste

A `MusicalWorkRating` is attributed to a **person** — the current user *or* any contact — via
`(Person)-[:RATED]->(MusicalWorkRating)`, and carries `raterName`/`raterId` (the same model as
[`realm-movie`](../realm-movie)). Your own `AssistantUser` node is also a `Person`, so one uniform edge covers
everyone. The saved forms are `RatingsByRater` / `MutualFavourites` / `DividedOpinions`. These populate once
more than one person has ratings — recording another person's ratings is a **seeding** operation today
(`create_entry` only auto-anchors the current user).

```cypher
-- Works you and one named person both love
MATCH (me:AssistantUser)-[:RATED]->(rm:MusicalWorkRating)          WHERE rm.rating >= 8
MATCH (other:Person)-[:RATED]->(ro:MusicalWorkRating)
  WHERE other <> me AND other.name = 'Ada Lovelace'
    AND ro.rating >= 8 AND ro.workId = rm.workId
RETURN rm.composer AS Composer, rm.title AS Work, rm.rating AS Mine, ro.rating AS Theirs ORDER BY Work
```
```cypher
-- SHARED recommendations — works that appeal to BOTH, new to both. Two SIMILAR_TO fan-outs intersect;
-- works because a generative pick can name every anchor it resembles (sourceIndexes). ~1–2 min.
MATCH (me:AssistantUser)-[:RATED]->(rm:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE rm.rating >= 8
MATCH (rm)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(w:MusicalWork)
MATCH (other:Person)-[:RATED]->(ro:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE other.name = 'Ada Lovelace' AND ro.rating >= 8
MATCH (ro)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(w)
WHERE NOT EXISTS { (s:MusicalWorkRating) WHERE s.workId = w.workId }
RETURN DISTINCT w.composer, w.title LIMIT 20
```

## Type methods (`src/api/work.ts`)

`MusicalWork extends Entity`. Its async methods are affordances on an in-scope
work object:

- `work.recordings({ count? })` → YouTube watch links for performances of the work (Brave search).
- `work.details()` → re-resolve the work's Open Opus metadata.
- `work.rate({ rating, notes?, heardOn? })` → record a `MusicalWorkRating` (auto-links `RATED`).
- `work.neighbors({ hops })` → inherited graph walk from this work's node.

Build and test:

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test          # vitest — methods run against a mocked gateway, no keys needed
npm run build     # tsc -> dist/ + manifest
```

## Why no separate Composer / Performer entities?

The `impromptu` app models a rich reference graph (Composer, Ensemble, Performer,
Epoch, Genre, Instrument, …). This realm deliberately keeps only `MusicalWork` and
the user's `MusicalWorkRating`: the composer and genre are denormalised onto the
work, recordings and scores are virtual (fetched on demand, never stored), and
anything about the *user's* taste is the DICE proposition graph's job — not a
second entity that drifts. If a deployment wants the full composer graph, that is
Open Opus bulk-population, a separate concern from this query-time realm.
